# Mars_News-Challenge

This challenge is focused on web-scraping and data analysis of information related to Mars. The project consists of two parts: Part 1 is a Jupyter notebook containing code that scrapes the Mars news titles and preview text. Part 2 is a Jupyter notebook containing code that scrapes the Mars weather data and that cleans, visualizes, and analyzes that data.
